The Sad, Sad story of Venom Software:


Back at the beginning of 2020, Venom Remote Software was listed for sale on a competing forum for outrageous prices($150/month).
I purchased this solely for analysis, which I normally do simply to understand the market and how trending malware works. This is the only purchase in which I genuinely felt ripped off enough to feed to ForlaxPy(now known as Chiros)[see fig 1--], who posted it in the exclusive tools section, featured above. The software was copy/paste github code, to which Forlax made somewhat usable with restructuring. Thanks Forlax. Quick round of applause.

Venom began attempting to DDoS c.to to bring it down--as of which he failed miserably and went black across every forum for almost 6 months.

Got it, we killed the snake.
Chop em like Harry Potter killing the basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets.

Right?

Nah.
Buddy came back with a reskin of his trash software, paid for rep and began pushing sales again with a new business model. To which I dove head first into finding out about this creature.
Not only does he rip people off selling them repackaged open source code, he blatantly accepts convicted pedophiles using his tool.

Venom has ripped off his last dollar from these communities, with a whopping 9% customer satisfaction rate from a recent study [see fig. 3--] we have made sure of it.

So today, we present to you a working, functional, pseudo angsty tool; Venom Software 2.8 FINAL.
Just as it should be: Free as the software that was compiled into it like an MTV: Big Shiny Tunes album.
